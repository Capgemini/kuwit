It is not a secret that the industry is betting hard on building AI engines using the power of on machine learning and big data to provide the foundation for delivering extremely personalized user experience.
Platforms like [fb learner flow](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1072626246134461/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), or services like [Microsoft Cornana](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/cortana-intelligence-suite), [Google Machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/) or [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/watson/) are just a few examples.

One the multiple possibilities that arises is building chatbots based on [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) for changing the way humans interact with computers and reducing the friction between both when offering a service.

A good example on this line is [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/). Wit is a service that helps you to build your conversational app by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to undertand and extract meaningful information out of the user input.

# Putting things together

At Capgemini we have been building [solutions around Mesos](https://github.com/capgemini/apollo) or [Kubernetes](https://github.com/Capgemini/kubeform) for a while now.

This techonologies are in a certain sense an abstraction over the underlying infrastructure. They completely change and rethink the way that humans interact with datacenters, clusters, machines and the way we deal with the orchestration of the apps. It makes it more natural for us.

In accordance with this idea it would be also possible to go a bit farther and to change the way we interact with these platforms by making it easier and more natural for the human to transmit his desires.

# Introducing KuWit

[KuWit](http://kuwit.io), the AI bot who knows everything about Kubernetes.

![KuWit](/images/kuwit-architecture.png)

He's built on the shoulders of wit.ai and is becoming smarter every day by training and using Natural Language Processing.

KuWit relies on Wit for making predictions and extracting entities from natural language and then executes actions and retrieve information from external APIs in order to finally deliver a meaningful user output.

At the moment KuWit has three main functions:

* Teach about Kubernets

* Interact with your Kubernetes cluster.

* Follow the latest news about Kubernetes on the internet.

You can check it out and use it as a service on [KuWit](http://kuwit.io) or just clone it from https://github.com/enxebre/kuwit and customise it and deploy it on your own platform.


# Future plans

* Improve KuWit understanding capacity.

* At the moment KuWit runs in a single Docker container. We should be able to provide a PoC providing a serverless solution in a [s3](https://aws.amazon.com/es/s3/) + [lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/lambda/) style.
